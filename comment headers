/*
*   NAME    : Clock 
*   PURPOSE : The Clock class has been created to accurately model the behavior of a standard 
*             wall clock.  The Clock has members to track the hour, minute and second.  The 
*             Clock also has the ability to adjust the member values in case they need to be 
*             adjusted.  The Date class depends on the Clock classâ€™ ability to signal the  
*             midnight event to mark the beginning of a new day.
